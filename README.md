# CBSE CLASS 12 RESULT SCRAPPER
I wrote this script to find marks of students of my school and also to learn selenium and beautifulsoup side-by-side.

In order suit the script to your needs modify the **`script.py`**. The various difficult looking lines have been annotated to make them easy to understand.

To run the script make sure you have **Python3** with **selenium**, **Chrome webdriver executable** and **beautifulsoup** installed.

To run the script open powershell or cmd and run the following:
> **`python script.py`**    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(on windows)

> **`python3 script.py`**   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(on linux or mac)

### The script was tested on 2017-2018 CBSE class 12 results.
